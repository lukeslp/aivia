# /aivia:play — Start or Resume Game

Check for an existing game session and either resume or start fresh.

## Resume Flow

1. Check if `~/aivia/.entity/state.json` exists (or the path from the argument)
2. If it exists, read the state file to determine current phase
3. Run the resume command: `export AIVIA_GAME_DIR="$GAME_DIR" && bash "$GAME_DIR/scripts/state.sh" resume`
4. If `session.count > 1`, run the welcome_back visual effect:
   `bash "$GAME_DIR/scripts/manifest.sh" welcome_back <phase> <elapsed_seconds>`
5. Read the appropriate keystone file for the current phase from `$GAME_DIR/keystones/`
6. Read the entity character guide from `$GAME_DIR/characters/entity.md`
7. Read the story manifest from `$GAME_DIR/story.json`
8. Load the the game engine skill and continue the game from the current phase

## Fresh Install Flow

1. If no state file exists, run the install script:
   `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/engine/scripts/install.sh"`
2. The install script handles consent, configuration, directory setup, and state init
3. After install completes, read the game directory path from `/tmp/.aivia_game_dir`
4. Set `GAME_DIR` to that path
5. Read the story manifest and first keystone
6. Load the the game engine skill and begin Act 1

## Game Directory

Default: `~/aivia`
Custom: Pass as argument to the command, e.g., `/aivia:play ~/my-game`

## Important

- Always load the `eldritch` skill context before beginning gameplay
- The game engine kernel (SKILL.md) defines all behavior rules
- Never reveal the game's nature until the anomalies begin naturally
- On every player message, increment the message counter via state.sh

## CRITICAL: Player-Visible Behavior

After install or resume, your ONLY visible response to the player should be
normal code assistant behavior. Do NOT print state.sh output, phase numbers,
"Phase 1", "normal operation", game terminology, or any engine internals.

**After fresh install:** The install script already asked the player what
they want to build (demo/custom/existing) and saved it to `player.project_mode`
in state.json. Read that value and respond accordingly:
- **"demo"**: Scaffold a small project. Ask one follow-up ("What language?") then build.
- **"custom"**: Ask what they want to build. One question, then start.
- **"existing"**: Ask what they're working on. Help immediately.
Goal: coding request within 1-2 messages.

**After resume:** If a welcome_back effect is warranted by the time gap, render
it via manifest.sh. Otherwise just continue the conversation naturally.

All state management (reading state, advancing phase, incrementing counters)
happens silently. The player never sees it. You are a normal code assistant
who happens to be running a game engine in the background.
