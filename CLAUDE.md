## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run smoke tests
cd plugins/aivia && bash test.sh

# Test individual effects
cd plugins/aivia/engine && bash scripts/manifest.sh <effect> [args]
bash scripts/manifest.sh help          # List all effects

# Test voice styles
cd plugins/aivia/engine && bash scripts/voice.sh "text" <style>

# Interactive tester (effects + voice with controls)
cd plugins/aivia/engine && bash scripts/tester.sh

# State management (requires AIVIA_GAME_DIR)
export AIVIA_GAME_DIR=~/aivia
bash plugins/aivia/engine/scripts/state.sh read
bash plugins/aivia/engine/scripts/state.sh get phase
```

## Plugin Installation

Install as a Claude Code plugin: `/plugin add lukeslp/aivia`

Commands: `/aivia:play` (start/resume), `/aivia:exit` (quit), `/aivia:status` (progress)

## Key Concepts

- **Plugin source** (`~/projects/aivia/plugins/aivia/`) vs **game directory** (`~/aivia/`) — install.sh copies engine to game dir; gameplay targets game dir only
- **Three rendering channels**: inline unicode (primary), player-executed breakout scripts (ANSI), bash effects as style reference (never player-visible)
- **Entity is NOT Claude** — separate fictional character with its own voice and arc
- **Safety**: all operations stay within game dir, exit commands always work instantly, entity threats are empty bluffs
